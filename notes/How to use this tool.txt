How to use:

This is a weird workflow, but:

1. Right click on "Rooms" and go to "add existing"
2. Add your existing room that you have setup.  This will import all the objects into this application.
3. Feel free to just delete the objects, we only care about the room layout.
4. In the room we just created, add the script InitializeMesher() to the creation code
5. Run the app!
